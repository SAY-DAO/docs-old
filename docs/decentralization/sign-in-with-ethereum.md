# Approach

Implementing sign-in with Ethereum (SIWE) is one of the first steps toward decentralization.

The [login.xyz](https://login.xyz) project is a great project that we can use to achieve this goal.

## System Goals

In SAY, we can use this feature to:

1. Create a new way for `current` users/social workers to sign-in to the current app.

2. Create a new way for `new` users/social workers to create an account on the current app.

3. Unifiy sign-in and sign-up flows.

4. Gain access to (virtually) limitless blockchain opportunities.(On-chain identity verification, reward/credit distribution, etc.)
