Implementing sign-in with Ethereum (SIWE) is one of first steps toward decentralization.

The https://login.xyz project is a great project that we can use to achive this goal.


## System Goals


In SAY, we can use this feature to: 

1. Create a new way for `current` users/social workers to sign-in to current app.
2. Create a new way for `new` users/social workers to create their account on the current app.
3. Unifiy sign-in and sign-up flows.
4. Open up to (virtually) unlimited possibilitis in the blockchain space. (On-chain identity verification, reward/credit distribution, ...)
